    Sorts a package into a stack based on its dimensions and mass.

    Note:
        bulky: A package is considered bulky if its volume is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or any of its dimensions (width, height, length) is greater than or equal to 150 cm.
        heavy: A package is considered heavy if its mass is greater than or equal to 20 kg.

    Args:
        width (float): The width of the package in cm.
        height (float): The height of the package in cm.
        length (float): The length of the package in cm.
        mass (float): The mass of the package in kg.

    Returns:
        str: The name of the stack for this package ("STANDARD", "SPECIAL", or "REJECTED").
